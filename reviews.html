    <p>"<i>Working with Studio-Marginalia was a highlight of my career. I'd planned for a 3 book series and she was instrumental in getting it off the ground. 
      Things I didn't see, a world that didn't fully make sense, character actions that were uninspired - she found it all! 
      And my work is much better for it!"</i><br><b>- Author D.H George</b></p>

  <blockquote class="bg-paper p-6 rounded-xl shadow-soft text-olive">
    <p>"<i>From start to finish, working with Studio-Marginalia was a delight. She let me voice my worries beforehand and made me feel confident sending my manuscript to a stranger over the internet.
        She was patient when I kept checking in on her throughout the process and she delivered five days ahead of time.
        And when I say delivered, I mean DELIVERED! She saw so much I didn't see and was on a call with me for more than an hour to discuss the report.
        She was able to explain her thoughts and suggestions very clearly - both in the report and on call.
        Her character work was very deep and thorough and she was able to diagnose that fixing my characters would fix my story.  
        It was like giving me a lantern to light a dark path. Now I know where to go next and why I'm going there.
        I am beyond grateful. I'll be coming back again and again!"</i><br><b>- Author Macy King</b></p>

  <blockquote class="bg-paper p-6 rounded-xl shadow-soft text-olive">
    <p>"<i>Studio-Marginalia alpha read for me and her feedback was fantastic. Her critique was constructive and very helpful. 
      Additionally she highlighted her favorite parts along with the list I sent her, and knowing what parts worked and what needed to be improved on was great! 
      I loved reading her feedback in the lines and all of it made me smile, along with giggles. She caught some things some previous beta readers had not.
      Her work is very thorough and detailed. I'm so excited for her to work with me on my upcoming books. Hire her, you won't regret it!."</i><br><b> - Author Danicah Shah</b></p>

  <blockquote class="bg-paper p-6 rounded-xl shadow-soft text-olive">
    <p>"<i>I used Studio-Marginalia to help me properly dial down the story for my webcomic. She came as a recommendation from a friend and boy am I glad I asked around!
        She was gracious enough to quote me a solid price to read my behemoth of an outline for a story I've been sitting on for 8 years and she was so thorough that the document she sent back rivaled mine!
        I came back to her for some help with writing the narrative and she once again accomodated me. 
        She helped me shape my world and I am forever in her debt."</i><br><b>- Cartoonist rottenevilpotato</b></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="bg-paper p-6 rounded-xl shadow-soft text-olive">
    <p>"<i>I connected with Studio-Marginalia via Reddit and I sent over the manuscript of a story I have a deep connection to. 
      I think that, as an author, the hardest thing you can ever do is give out your manuscript for feedback. I was worried she'd hate the story and wouldn't connect with my characters the way I did. 
      I was very wrong. My favorite thing about her service were the comments! I loved reading through them and seeing someone who clearly really enjoyed reading my mansucript.
      It didn't feel like she was paid; it felt like a friend laughing right along in the margins with me.
      She gave me some very good suggestions and was able to explain why she made them and how they'd serve the story. It was well worth the cost.
      Thank you to Reddit for making all of this possible!"</i><br><b> - Author Anonymous</b></p>
